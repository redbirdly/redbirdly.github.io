    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Sandboxels</strong> is a sandbox game where players can create and manipulate elements on a grid, similar to falling sand games. It allows for extensive creativity and experimentation with various materials and circuits, enabling players to design and test their own simulations and contraptions.</p>
    <p><strong>CircuitCore.js</strong> is a mod for the sandbox game <strong>Sandboxels</strong> that provides a variety of digital circuits for building complex electronic systems. It extends the functionality of the game by introducing advanced logic components and circuits that can be used to create intricate logic systems, memory storage, and arithmetic operations.</p>    
    <p><strong>LogicGates.js</strong> is another mod required for CircuitCore.js, which provides basic logic gates like AND, OR, and XOR. CircuitCore.js builds upon these basic logic gates by offering more advanced components such as registers, counters, and various types of shift registers.</p>
